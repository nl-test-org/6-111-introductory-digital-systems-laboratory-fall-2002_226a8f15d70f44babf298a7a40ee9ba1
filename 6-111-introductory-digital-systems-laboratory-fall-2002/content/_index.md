6.111 consists of lectures and labs on digital logic, flipflops, PALs, counters, timing, synchronization, finite-state machines, and microprogrammed systems. Students are expected to design and implement a final project of their choice: games, music, digital filters, graphics, etc. The course requires extensive use of VHDL for describing and implementing digital logic designs. 6.111 is worth 12 Engineering Design Points.
